# Open ToDo Items

## Major
- Add a proper installation workflow and describe it in README.md
    - add a requirements.txt file
    - either add a setup.py, Dockerfile or any other established approach
- Refactor code, both `transmic.py` and `transmiclib.py`:
    - make code more modular, ideally encapsulate in one or multiple classes
    - consider splitting the functions into multiple files, depending on their context
- Add unit tests and potentially additional data files used by the tests 


## Minor
- Evaluate if the key libraries used in the project (dendropy) are up to date and test the project with the updated libraries
